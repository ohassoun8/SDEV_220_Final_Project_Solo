Calorie & Macro Calculator
Project Overview
The Calorie & Macro Calculator is a Python application that helps users determine two things crucial to understanding diet and nutrition: how much energy a person burns in a day (TDEE) and how they should distribute their macronutrients (carbs, protein, fat).

Using Tkinter, I built a simple graphical user interface (GUI) around the application to make it easier to interact with for the common user.
This instrument is particularly beneficial for people aiming to add pounds and develop muscle, because it lays out in a clear, structured way what sorts of food they need to eat to reach those goals. There's no more guessing involved; in fact, some might even say it's a bit dictatorial. According to this tool, you consume either too few or too many calories.

Features
Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE): Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) represents the number of calories you burn each day. This is a good starting point if you're looking to change your body size or composition.
Distributing Macronutrients: Recommends how much carbohydrate, protein, and fat you should eat.
BMI Computes: Weight and Height the on Index Mass Body (BMI) .calculates
Exercise Recording: Permits users to record their exercise and file them for future reference.
A clean and intuitive user interface with validation of inputs.
The design is customizable: a grayscale theme; inclusion of a logo; and images.

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Pillow Library: Required for image handling in Tkinter. Install it using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install pillow
Steps to Run the Application
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/ohassoun8/SDEV_220_Final_Project_Solo.git
cd SDEV_220_Final_Project_Solo
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:
Execute the Python script to launch the application:

bash
Copy
python fitness_program.py
Using the Application:

Enter your details (age, weight, height, gender, and activity level).

Click the "Calculate BMI" button to see your BMI.

Enter your workout in the workout log section and click "Save Workout" to log it.

The application will display your TDEE and macronutrient distribution.


Future Improvements
Nutrition Guide: An addendum to suggest high-calorie, healthful foods for mass gaining.
Water Consumption Calculator: Incorporate a tool to determine the daily consumption of water.
Daily Meal Organizer: Create a daily meal organizer to assist users in planning their meals.
Tracking Progress: Implement a function that allows the user to monitor their mass and energy intake over a given duration.
